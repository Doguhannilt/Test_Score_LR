## Summary
This project showcases my proficiency in employing object-oriented programming (OOP) within Python for data science tasks. Through modular code organization and the utilization of OOP principles, this project demonstrates the following:

- Modularity: The codebase is divided into distinct classes and objects, each responsible for specific data science functions.
- Reusability: OOP design fosters the creation of reusable components, enhancing efficiency across projects.
- Abstraction: Complex data science processes are abstracted into simplified interfaces, improving code readability.
- Scalability: The OOP structure facilitates the management of expanding data science projects.
- Customization: Tailored data types (classes) are developed to handle domain-specific datasets effectively.

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Run the `data_preprocessing.ipynb` notebook in the `notebooks` directory to preprocess the raw data using the `data_preprocessor.py` module.

2. **Run Main Script**: Execute the `main.py` script to showcase the integration of OOP concepts in loading and analyzing data.

## Project Highlights

- Demonstrated use of object-oriented programming (OOP) in data preprocessing and analysis.
- Clear separation of concerns through modular code structure in the `src` directory.
- Leveraged Jupyter notebooks for interactive data analysis and visualization.
- Utilized external libraries like pandas, matplotlib, etc. for efficient data manipulation and visualization.

## Future Enhancements

- Incorporate machine learning models using OOP principles.
- Create a web-based dashboard for interactive data exploration.
- Expand the project to handle larger datasets and real-world scenarios.
